  created_date: "20240215"
  name: kserve-caikit-test-using-pipeline
  description: |
    This role is to test the caikit runtime with kserve, it requires RHOAI Operator installed without ModelMesh Serving
    The last task will check the model using caikit_nlp client with the gRPC and HTTP protocols.
    

    
    This role orchestrates the installation process of an OpenShift cluster and provides essential information about 
    the cluster's configuration and access credentials upon successful completion.
    
    The pipeline will do the following actions:
      - check if there are any resources from previous runs and delete them
      - deploy the MinIO storage configuration
      - fetches the git repo to get the needed scripts
      - deploy two caikit runtimes with kserve: one for gRPC and another for http
      - check if the runtimes were created
      - deploy the http and gRPC Inference Services
      - Infer the mode using both protocols
      - clean the namespace used for the tests
    
    A example of how to run it:
    
     ./loopy roles run test-kserve-caikit-tgis-using-pipeline \
        -p MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin \
        -p MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password \
        -p MINIO_S3_SVC_URL=http://minio.pipeline-test.svc:9000 \ 
        -p CLUSTER_API_URL=https://api.openshiftapps.com:443 \
        -p CLUSTER_ADMIN_ID=user \
        -p CLUSTER_ADMIN_PW=passwd \
        -p EXTRA_PARAMS="-sp someparam"

    To get the list of parameters:

     ./loopy roles run test-kserve-caikit-tgis-using-pipeline \
        -p MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin \
        -p MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password \
        -p MINIO_S3_SVC_URL=http://minio.pipeline-test.svc:9000 \ 
        -p CLUSTER_API_URL=https://api.openshiftapps.com:443 \
        -p CLUSTER_ADMIN_ID=user \
        -p CLUSTER_ADMIN_PW=passwd \
        -p EXTRA_PARAMS="-h"
