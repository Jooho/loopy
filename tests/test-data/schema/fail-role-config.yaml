    This role help to generate self singed certificate. 
    The default execution create a SAN certificate for minio

    pre-requirements:
      N/A

    Input Environment:
      The parameters include:
      - SAN_DNS_LIST: Set SAN DNS hostname (ex "minio.minio.svc.cluster.local,minio-minio.test"). You can generate wildcard cert as well (ex, *.example.com")
      - SAN_IP_LIST: Set SAN IP address (ex "192.0.0.1,192.0.0.2")
      
      You can set both paramters. For more parameters, you can check config.yaml file.

    To run it:
    ./loopy roles run cert-generate  \
    -p SAN_DNS_LIST=minio.minio.svc.cluster \
    -p SAN_IP_LIST=192.0.0.1
